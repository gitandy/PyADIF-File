PyADIF-File
===========
Convert ADIF ADI content to dictionary and vice versa

The required/resulting dictionary format is

    {
        'HEADER': 
            {Header param: Value,
             'USERDEFS': [list of user definitions]},
        'RECORDS': [list of records]
    }

The header or each record is/must be a dictionary in the format
    
    {
        ADIF parameter name: Text value,
    }

A user definition is a dictionary of
    
    {
        'dtype': one char representing the type,
        'userdef': the field definition text
    }

You have to care about reading/writing the content from/to the file.

Installation

Exporting ADI
